// Please use the style & syntax-help outlined here: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/graphgist/blob/master/gists/syntax.adoc
// This is also a good example for a GraphGist: https://gist.github.com/jexp/2014efa6448b307c65e9

== Introduction

REPLACEME: Introductory text and domain model image.

////
Provide an introduction to your domain and what you are trying to accomplish, link to http://a.source.com[sources] as needed.

Provide a domain model image - using something like http://www.apcjones.com/arrows/# or https://www.gliffy.com/ or a readable screenshot from Neo4j-Browser.

You can run this query to get an overview of entities and how they are related:
MATCH (a)-[r]->(b) WHERE labels(a) <> [] AND labels(b) <> []
RETURN DISTINCT head(labels(a)) AS This, type(r) as To, head(labels(b)) AS That LIMIT 10

== Setup

////
A Cypher query to setup the database
Please use a small sample of your domain, at most 150 nodes and 200 relationships are enough for the pedagocial example.
You can link to the setup of a larger dataset or LOAD CSV queries in a second file of your GitHub Gist at the end.
In your setup query you can also use LOAD CSV loading CSV files from your GitHub Gist, like here: https://gist.github.com/jexp/f78df7b232d0faa171ff

== REPLACEME: FIRST USECASE TITLE

// REMOVEME: Describe what this use-case is solving and how the query represents that

// REMOVEME: A Cypher query with tabular output, returning scalar values

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Person {name: 'Alice'})-[:FRIENDS_WITH]-(:Person)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]-(fof:Person)
RETURN fof.name as fof, count(*) as frequency
----

//table

== REPLACEME: SECOND USE-CASE TITLE

// REMOVEME: Describe what this use-case is solving and how the query represents that

// REMOVEME: A Cypher query to with graph output

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path=(a:Person {name: 'Alice'})-[:FRIENDS_WITH]-(:Person)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]-(fof:Person)
RETURN path, a, fof
----

//graph_result

////
// You can also use both graph_result and then table if you return full nodes, relationships or paths
////

== REPLACEME: THIRD USE-CASE TITLE
// REMOVEME: add as many use-cases as make sense

// optional section
== Conclusions

REPLACEME: Offer a conclusion

// optional section
== Resources

REPLACEME: Link to resorces like data sources, further discussions, 

// optional Footer
